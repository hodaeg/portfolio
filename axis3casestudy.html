                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p><a href="https://creativelyfocused.net/how-we-support/" class="links">axis3</a>, a platform to support Special Education teachers, was in need of a feature to help them manage their Due Process paperwork efficiently and without error.</p>
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <p><strong>Timelines</strong> is a feature to help Special Educators demystify Due Process so they can get back to what they do best -- teaching.</p>

                <div class="caption">
                    <p><i><strong>"Wait, what's Due Process?"</strong></i></p>
                    <p>Due Process is the legally-mandated collection of tasks, paperwork, meetings, and reports that every Special Education teacher must adhere to for each of their students.</p>
                </div>
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <h3>Role & Scope</h3>
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <p>As the <strong>Digital Experience Designer</strong> for <a href=https://creativelyfocused.net/ class="links">Creatively Focused</a>, I had the responsibility to conduct user research, lead ideation, develop prototypes, and conduct user testing.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="caseStudyGrid" id="csGrid5a3">

                <h1>Research and Definition</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="csItemA1">
                <h2>Research Plan</h2>
                <p>Teacher burnout is a problem throughout all of education, but especially so for those in Special Education. When I first began at Creatively Focused, I wanted to know: <i>"Why Special Educators? What's unique about their story?"</i></p>
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <p>To figure this out, I developed a research plan that involved <strong>interviewing 25 educators</strong> from various sectors of Special Education.</p>
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <p>The educators held various roles, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Special Education Teachers</li>
                    <li>Paraprofessionals</li>
                    <li>Special Education Administrators</li>
                    <li>Special Education Coordinators</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After hours of interviews, it was clear that Due Process and all the paperwork associated with it was weighing down on Special Educators. This time sink had to be addressed -- enter, Timelines.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Problem Statement</h3></strong>
                    <p>How can Timelines help Special Education Teachers save time, cut down on Due Process errors, and allow them to spend more time with students?</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="csItemB1">
                <h2>Use Cases</h2>
                <p>As I began to whiteboard and discuss the development of the Timeline feature, I began to ask myself -- how can this feature serve <strong>all</strong> of the axis3 users -- not just those managing all of the paperwork?</p>
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <p>Through my research, I identified three major user bases and three specific stories that I needed to ensure the Timeline feature adequatly addressed.</p>
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <h3>Prioritized journeys</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Special Education teachers need to be able to easily track their paperwork and monitor key upcoming dates for each student.</li>
                    <li>Special Education coordinators and administrators need to be able to see all the Due Process projects at-a-glance to be aware of any compliance (overdue) risks.</li>
                    <li>The parents and other non-department staff need to be able to understand what milestones their child or student are reaching.</li>
                </ol>

            </div>
            <div class="csItemA2">
                <p>When I sat down to design Timlines, I knew that axis3 was already a mature platform -- it had a foundation on which I would need to design around. This included where the feature could populate, how much space it could take, and considerations to be taken regarding the tech stack of the platform. </p>
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <p>With these caveats in mind, I began to prototype to ensure I could reach my goal of successfully meeting the requirements of each of the stories.</p>

                <p>The Special Education teacher's priority is ensuring that all Due Process tasks are completed on time. The timeline management module ensures that this priority is met.</p>

                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <p >Although administrators and coordinators will need to edit timelines from time-to-time, it was most important for them to be able to view all active Due Process projects at-a-glance so that they can ensure that all due dates are met.</p>

                <p>Lastly, it was important that the Due Process Timeline was able to viewed in more digestible formats. These views can be leveraged during meetings or when discussing a particular student.</p>

                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <p>Three rounds of user testing were conducted to help promote usability and ensure that all content was accurate. The tested users were both internal, cross-team, and external users. I conducted the user testing in-person and remote using both <strong>unmoderated and moderated methods</strong> to ensure the feature didn't miss the mark.</p>

                <h6>Metrics</h6>
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <p>The crux of any education initiative -- how would I determine if the feature is ultimately doing what it's set out to do?</p>
                <span class="spacer"></span>
                <p>Thankfully, in this case, it was quite easy:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>NPS scores provided in-app.</li>
                    <li># of state-recorded compliance issues reduced district-wide.</li>
                    <li>Periodic feedback surveys.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>And much more...</h3>
            <span class="spacer"></span>
            <p>In designing the Timeline feature, I also performed the following tasks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IA Audit</strong> of the knowledge base.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> audit of the platform.</li>
                <li><strong>Created a new design system</strong> including typography, icons, and components for the platform.</li>
                <li>...and, alot more.</li>
            </ul>
